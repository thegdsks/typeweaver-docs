<GlinProfanityOverview />

## Why Glin-Profanity?

Unlike traditional profanity filters that rely on simple word matching, Glin-Profanity uses advanced context-aware analysis to understand the sentiment and intent behind text. This sophisticated approach dramatically reduces false positives while maintaining high accuracy in detecting truly inappropriate content.

### The Problem with Traditional Filters

Most profanity detection systems suffer from high false positive rates because they can't understand context:

- **"This movie is fucking amazing!"** → ❌ Flagged as inappropriate (but it's positive!)  
- **"That boss fight is badass!"** → ❌ Flagged in gaming contexts (but it's praise!)
- **"Damn good coffee!"** → ❌ Flagged as profane (but it's a compliment!)

### The Glin-Profanity Difference

Our context-aware system understands nuance and intent:

- **Advanced NLP Analysis** - Examines surrounding words and sentiment patterns
- **Domain Intelligence** - Recognizes gaming, movie, and product contexts
- **Cross-Language Consistency** - 23 languages with identical behavior
- **Production Testing** - 130+ comprehensive tests ensure reliability

## Cross-Platform Excellence  

Perfect feature parity between JavaScript/TypeScript and Python implementations:

```javascript title="JavaScript/TypeScript"
import { checkProfanity } from 'glin-profanity';

const result = checkProfanity('This is damn good!', {
  enableContextAware: true,
  languages: ['english']
});

console.log(result.containsProfanity); // false - positive context detected
```

```python title="Python"
from glin_profanity import Filter

filter_instance = Filter({
    "enable_context_aware": True,
    "languages": ["english"]
})

result = filter_instance.check_profanity("This is damn good!")
print(result["contains_profanity"])  # False - positive context detected
```
